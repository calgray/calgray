### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer from Western Australia working on the [SKA LOW and MID Telescope](https://www.skao.int/en) constructed in Australia and South Africa. I contribute to several open-source projects such as [boost-ext/ut](https://github.com/boost-ext/ut), [xtensor](https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtensor) and [athreading](https://github.com/calgray/athreading).

I currently work for [ICRAR](https://www.icrar.org) a non-profit research based organisation building Data Intensive solutions for Astronomy and Science.
